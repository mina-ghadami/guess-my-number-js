# guess-my-number-js


A simple browser-based game built with JavaScript where the player tries to guess a hidden number between 0 and 20.

## How the Game Works
- The game generates a random number between **0 and 20**.
- The player starts with a **score of 20**.
- For every incorrect guess, the score **decreases by 1**.
- The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
- When the correct number is found, the remaining score is saved as the **high score**.
- If the guessed number is far from the correct number, the player receives **feedback hints** to guide them.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and game logic)

## Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates basic JavaScript skills, including:
- Working with the DOM
- Handling user input and events
